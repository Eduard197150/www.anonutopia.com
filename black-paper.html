                            <h3>Anonutopia Black Paper</h3>

                            <p>In crypto-anarchist movement there's a need for a building block of the free society of the future, a tool for 
                            self-governing and self-organization of people developing projects on a large scale without the need of third party
                            entity like country or company. Anote aims to be that tool with Anonutopia as a top level decentralized organization
                            watching over the project by using the Anote itself as a tool to do it.</p>

                            <p>Anonutopia's goal is to create a self-sustainable ecosystem with its own currencies, infrastructure that runs those 
                            currencies, built-in user support, community that decides about the project in a democratic manner and incentives 
                            for the developers to fullfil the needs of the community.</p>

                            <p>After that basic goal is reached, we will develop apps and services on our decentralized infrastructure and provide 
                            jobs. Apps like Uber (AnonTaxi), AirBnb, delivery app, decentralized software development agency etc.</p>

                            <p>Development of these projects will be financed by utilizing Anonutopia's first commercial project - AnonShout, a 
                            Telegram ads channel network and bot for auctioning ads on that network, using Anote, of course. The process of mining
                            itself is done by watching the ads.</p>

                            <p>Anonutopia uses mature and well tested technologies and projects. Our main tool for communication and user interface is 
                            Telegram Messenger and our cryptocurrency technology is Waves Platform. In the future, we will probably need to create our
                            own versions of those parts of the infrastructure. We use Telegram bots to communicate with Waves blockchain and that makes
                            us almost unstoppable right from the start.</p>

                            <p><strong><u>What we're aiming for is a better version of Bitcoin. One that is:</u></strong></p>

                            <p>

                                <i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Growing steadily</strong><br>

                                <i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Led democratically by the people who use it</strong><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4>Anote</h4>

                            <p>Anote is a Waves based cryptocurrency and that solves first three issues we wanted to solve (fast, cheap, ecologically 
                            sustainable). It's mined by paying attention to ads published on Telegram channels and that determines your mining power,
                            number of anotes you get in some amount of time.</p>
                            
                            <p>Tests have shown that lowering mining power to all participants makes the price on the exchanges rise and the other 
                            way around. This with the combination of value provided by purchased mining power (AINTs) and ads network channel to 
                            generate demand with Anote auctions gives as a simple mechanism for keeping Anote stable and growing steadily.</p>

                            <p>Anote is an educational cryptocurrency and the main token for paying for apps and services in Anonutopia.</p>

                            <h4>AINT - Anonutopia Infrastructure Token</h4>

                            <p>While Anote's role is paying for services and apps and storing and exchanging value, AINT (Anonutopia Infrastructure
                            Token) has multiple roles:</p>

                            <p>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of stake token<br>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mining power unit<br>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative token<br>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructure token<br>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdfunding token<br>
                            </p>

                            <p>Since it's much more complicated ecosystem than Bitcoin, the community will have to have a way to know how much they can
                            trust somebody, for example, person running a node. And since it's also a crowdfunding token, it can only be purchased and 
                            it's limited to 144.000. So if somebody purchases it, he will invest in the project and we can expect he will want good for
                            the project. That's proof of stake, in a nutshell.</p>

                            <p>It's also a mining power unit. You can purchase it and 1 AINT will give you 1 more anote per hour.</p>

                            <p>Because it's limited to very low amount, it's almost certain it will grow insanely and also fluctuate in price which will
                            make it a good speculative token.</p>

                            <p>By the principle of PoS (Proof of Stake), every important part of our infrastructure will be maintained and provided
                            exclusively by the people who own AINTs. That makes it an infrastructure token.</p>

                            <p>Part of AINTs will be used as a crowdfunding token for developing all the tools described here to the MVP (Minimum Viable
                            Product) version, to kickstart development of commercials apps and services and to finish complete and total decentralization.
                            At this point, we're half way there. You can read more on AINTs distribution lower in the paper.</p>

                            <h4>AnonShout</h4>

                            <p>AnonShout is Anonutopia's built in Telegram channel network for serving ads. Currently it has only one channel, but it will
                            be expanded by countries, interests etc. Ads on AnonShout are purchased through auctions done with anotes and this creates a 
                            deflation in the system. Watching ads on the channel rewards the miners with anotes.</p>

                            <p>Telegram channels are a great and cheap way of advertising. But they currently have an issue of connecting advertisers with 
                            channel owners. AnonShout aims to resolve this issue too. Its Telegram bot will provide channel owners with a feature to add their channel
                            into network and advertisers will get a single point of advertising on a large network of channels. This has a potential to generate
                            a huge demand on the Anote.</p>

                            <h4>AnonHelper</h4>

                            <p>AnonHelper is a built-in user support system for Anonutopia and everything connected to it. It has a Telegram group of people willing
                            to help other people and its own bot. If somebody needs a help, he asks for it and bot will send a notification in the group.
                            Anybody in the group can take over the conversation and if user on the other side is satisfied, helper will be rewarded with anotes.</p>

                            <p>AnonHelper bot will also have automated tutorials and challenges that will be rewarded with anotes for educational purposes and 
                            it can be used commercially right from the start to provide simple customer support for the companies.</p>

                            <h4>AnonCMS</h4>

                            <p>AnonCMS is a built-in tool for maintaining all Anonutopia websites utilizing Telegram and GitHub. It has a Telegram group of 
                            webmasters willing to do simple tasks for anotes and its own Telegram bot. When developers or community request a change on one of
                            the websites, bot will send a notification to the group, one of webmasters will accept it, resolve it with GitHub pull request and 
                            if community accepts it, he will be rewarded with anotes.</p>

                            <p>This service will also automatically be offered commercially too, for simple website maintenance.</p>

                            <h4>AnonDevs</h4>

                            <p>This is a built-in system for Anonutopia development. It also has a bot of its own and when community decides they want some 
                            feature implemented, the bot will notify the Telegram group of developers, one of them will accept it, resolve it and if community 
                            accepts GitHub pull request, the developer will be rewarded with some amount of anotes.</p>

                            <p>This service might grow into self-sustainable decentralized software development agency.</p>

                            <h4>AnonExchange</h4>

                            <p>Since buying and selling cryptocurrencies for "real" money is currently still an issue, AnonExchange aims to resolve it. It will 
                            be a built in decentralized exchange where anybody will be able to make a request for exchange for his local bank account and Telegram
                            bot will notify a group of people working with the exchange who will resolve the trade for them. These will be trusted people and 
                            this is where AINT comes in particularly handy as a proof of stake token.</p>

                            <p>This will have to be a "side job" because we'll have to keep amounts low in order not to alert the banks since they've proven
                            that they don't like cryptocurrencies. However, this is perfectly legal.</p>

                            <h4>Telegram and GitHub</h4>

                            <p>Telegram and GitHub are heavily used in Anonutopia. Telegram is used through a network of chat bots, groups and channels and 
                            particularly for communication, discussions and direct democracy.</p>

                            <p>GitHub is used for storing all our Open Source code and our websites and it's deeply integrated with some of our services 
                            like AnonCMS and AnonDevs.</p>

                            <h4>Stablecoins</h4>

                            <h4>Token Distribution</h4>
